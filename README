OA is one of the most frequent medical conditions in humans. 
According to estimates, up to half of the persons with osteoarthritic joint abnormalities seen by imaging or clinical examination are asymptomatic or have minor symptoms. 
OA is known to cause severe impairment in some sites, including the joint of the thumb, the hip and the knee joints. 

Data Set Details
The database used in this study were acquired from the Imorphics dataset which is a subset of the  public Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database. 
OAI that sponsored by the National Institutes of  Health was initiated to maintain a natural history database for osteoarthritis that contains clinical evaluation data, radiographic (X-ray and MRI) images, and other information.
It includes a multi-center that recruited 4796 men and women (ages 45–79 years) with or at risk for knee OA. 
The OAI’s overarching goal was to provide public resources to promote a better understanding of OA initiation and progression, which is one of the leading causes of disability in adults. 
Our database contains 99 cases of 3D knee MRI dual-echo steady-state (DESS) sequences that  turn up to be 15,840 total DICOM images. 
Each case consists of 160 2D slices with the original image size of 384 × 384 pixels. Each slice with bone structures was manually segmented and served as the ground truth in this study
